            <h1>I'M OLAOLUWA OKE, A STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WINNIPEG</h1>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Olaoluwa, a passionate CS student specializing in Applied Computer Science. With a strong foundation in various aspects of computer science, I am equipped with the knowledge and skills to tackle complex challenges in the field.

Throughout my academic journey, I have undertaken a diverse range of coursework that has shaped my understanding and expertise. In the 'Fundamentals of Java Programming' course (ACS1903), I gained a solid understanding of Java programming language, mastering concepts such as variables, control structures, and object-oriented programming principles. This course laid the groundwork for my programming skills and ignited my enthusiasm for software development.

 <br> <br>    Building upon that foundation, I continued to expand my Java programming proficiency in the 'Fundamentals of Java Programming II' course (ACS1904). This advanced course delved into topics like data structures, algorithms, and advanced programming techniques, enabling me to design efficient and scalable solutions to complex problems.

In the 'Intro to Web Design' course (ACS1803), I explored the principles and technologies underlying web development. I gained hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, learning to create interactive and visually appealing web applications.

Furthermore, I have completed coursework in various essential areas of computer science. Courses such as 'Internet Programming,' 'Software Requirements and Analysis,' 'Application to Database Systems,' 'Database Systems,' 'Discrete Maths,' 'Principles of Project Management,' 'Operating Systems,' 'Data Structures and Algorithms,' and 'Computer Architecture and System Software' have provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the core principles and practical applications in these domains.

   <br> <br> With a solid foundation in computer science theory and practical skills, I am well-equipped to approach complex projects and contribute effectively to software development teams. I am constantly seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge and enhance my problem-solving abilities.

 <br> <br>Outside of academics, I actively engage in personal coding projects and participate in coding competitions, which further sharpen my skills and enable me to explore emerging technologies. I am driven by a strong curiosity to delve deeper into the ever-evolving world of computer science and make meaningful contributions to the field
